 *
 * A weight rather than N sequential calls, deliberately: N calls compute N independent waits, each

 *    non-positive refill rate can never grant another token — the PREVIOUS code computed
 *    `waitMs = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and awaited it, but `setTimeout`'s own documented
 *    behavior clamps an out-of-range delay (anything `> 2147483647` or `< 1`) down to `1`, so that
 *    branch didn't actually hang forever, it silently resolved almost immediately, defeating the
 *    rate limit entirely without any signal that something was misconfigured.
 * 2. **Saturated bucket** (adversarial cycle 2, fix 7): the computed `waitMs` for THIS call
 *    exceeds `MAX_WAIT_MS` (30s) — e.g. a burst of concurrent callers has queued up a backlog
 *    deep enough that this caller's own slot is more than 30s out. Blocking a request handler for
 *    that long is worse than failing fast with a clear, typed, "this provider's rate limit is
 *    saturated" signal the caller's own fallback logic (or the MCP tool's `{ok:false, reason}`
 *    contract) can act on. The reserved token is refunded (`bucket.tokens += 1`) before this
 *    throw, so a rejected call — which will never actually consume its slot — doesn't permanently
 *    worsen the backlog for subsequent, legitimate callers.

/**
 * Builds a `throttle(providerId, config)` function with its own isolated per-`providerId` bucket
 * state (a factory, not a shared module singleton — mirrors the `CapabilityRegistry`/`CacheStore`
 * "factory, not singleton" principle, ARCHITECTURE.md §8). Tests call this directly with an
 * injected `now`/`wait` to get deterministic, real-timer-free assertions; the module-level
 * `throttle` export below is the production singleton (real clock/timers), built by calling this
 * with no overrides.
 *
 * Token-bucket algorithm: each `providerId` gets its own bucket, starting full (`capacity`
 * tokens). On every call, the bucket is refilled by `elapsedSeconds * refillPerSec` (capped at
 * `capacity`) based on time elapsed since its last check, then one token is unconditionally
 * consumed. If the resulting balance is still `>= 0`, the call proceeds immediately; otherwise it
 * waits exactly as long as needed for that deficit to refill (`-tokens / refillPerSec` seconds).
 *
 * **Concurrency-safety (adversarial cycle 1, fix C — findings merged).** The refill + consume +
 * decide-whether-to-wait step above is entirely SYNCHRONOUS — there is no `await` anywhere before
 * it fully commits the bucket's new state. This is what makes N concurrent same-`providerId`
 * callers (e.g. `await Promise.all([throttle(id, cfg), throttle(id, cfg), throttle(id, cfg)])`)
 * space out into distinct, cascading wait durations instead of racing on stale state: JS's
 * single-threaded execution model guarantees a batch of concurrent calls run their synchronous
 * prefixes back-to-back, in order, with no interleaving — the Nth call's math always sees the
 * (N-1)th call's fully-committed bucket, never a half-updated one.
 *
 * The PREVIOUS implementation broke exactly this guarantee: on the "must wait" path, it computed
 * `waitMs` from the CURRENT `tokens` value but deferred the actual state commit
 * (`bucket.tokens = 0; bucket.lastRefillMs = now()`) until AFTER `await wait(waitMs)` resolved.
 * Two callers arriving back-to-back while the first was still waiting would both read the SAME
 * pre-wait `tokens` value and compute the IDENTICAL `waitMs` — never spacing out. The fix: `tokens`
 * is allowed to go NEGATIVE and is committed synchronously, immediately, on every call (never
 * reset back to `0` after a real wait resolves) — each subsequent caller's synchronous math then
 * immediately accounts for every still-outstanding reservation ahead of it, so wait durations
 * correctly accumulate (e.g. 0ms, 500ms, 1000ms, ... for successive callers against a
 * 1-capacity/2-per-second bucket) with no explicit queue/mutex object needed.
